**Write**: Reflect on your previous work and how you would adjust to include ethics and inequity components. Total length should be a few paragraphs, no more than one page.

According to the ethics requirements it's very important to store data securely. First of all, I would like not to give access to many people. Secondly, if there is a requirement to work with such kind of data for more people maybe it's better to divide names and data into different tables and just delete table with names for the working .sql file so it will be only accessible for team lead of the project. Thirdly, it's important to use Enums as values so there will be more values if needed and more space for future development. Fourthly, do the review with the team and collect feedback from all users about ethics and inequity.
